                    <h2 class="top">What Is an analogy for describing the differences between
                        HTML and CSS:
                    </h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                            HTML and CSS are used for website presentation, so think of HTML as the
                            structure of your webpage (content) and CSS as the styles (font, colour, etc).
                            When trying to understand what the differences of HTML and css are, try
                            thinking of it as building a house. You have the frame, walls, roof, bedrooms,
                            entrance, kitchen, etc., this would be your HTML. Whereas the styling,
                            such as decorations, how tall walls are and the colour of them, would
                            be the CSS. So what I’m trying to say is HTML and CSS are quite like
                            building a house. When it comes to interacting with things in your
                            house, like turning on lights and starting the dishwasher, this
                             would be JavaScript.

                    <h2 class="top">Control flow and looping</h2>
                    <p>
                            A control flow in programs are just the order which the programs codes executes.
                            So basically having the first action and going down to the last execution, until
                            the action or task is complete. This is where loops come in. Loops is a function
                            which executes a repetitive task. Here’s an example:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Going for a walk:
                        </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Putting shoes on</li>
                                <li>Move left foot forward</li>
                                <li>Move right foot forward</li>
                                <li>Move left foot forward</li>
                                <li>Move right foot forward</li>
                                <li>Move left foot forward</li>
                                <li>Move right foot forward</li>
                                <li>Move left foot forward</li>
                                <li>Move right foot forward</li>
                                <li>Move left foot forward</li>
                                <li>Move right foot forward</li>
                                <li>Reached destination</li>
                            </ol>
                        <p>
                            Instead of writing this out, you can do these steps in-between repeatedly via looping,
                             until you’ve reached your destination. 
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="top">What is the DOM</h2>
                    <p>
                            <strong>D</strong>ocument <strong>O</strong>bject <strong>M</strong>odel provides
                            the means to interact with objects in an HTML document. Everything that makes
                            up your DOM is more generically known as <strong>nodes</strong>. These nodes
                            can be elements, attributes, text, content, comments, document-related stuff,
                            and various other things you simply never think about.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Ever heard of the term “tree-structure”? If not you’ll hear it a lot in working with
                            the DOM. The DOM organises your html into a tree structure, which each element then
                            becomes a separate node and the way to access this would be to open your developer
                            tools, which is built into browsers at the top right of any website you’re on. You
                            can use this feature to manipulate and change elements of your choice.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="top">Arrays and Objects</h2>
                    <p>
                            Firstly what is an array? Arrays are like a collection of a fixed number of values of
                             a single type. The way to access the data within an array is typing the array name
                              and the position you want the data form. Example: 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            var arrayname = [item 1, item 2, item 3] <br>
                            arrayname[0] 
                            
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            This will display the arrayname and item 1, because computers start with the value 0
                            instead 1. So item 1 is really number 0. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        
                    </p>
