                        HTML and CSS:
                    </h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                            HTML and CSS are used for website presentation, so think of HTML as the
                            structure of your webpage (content) and CSS as the styles (font, colour, etc).
                            When trying to understand what the differences of HTML and css are, try
                            thinking of it as building a house. You have the frame, walls, roof, bedrooms,
                            entrance, kitchen, etc., this would be your HTML. Whereas the styling,
                            such as decorations, how tall walls are and the colour of them, would
                            be the CSS. So what Iâ€™m trying to say is HTML and CSS are quite like
                            building a house. When it comes to interacting with things in your
                            house, like turning on lights and starting the dishwasher, this
                             would be JavaScript.
