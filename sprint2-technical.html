                        When you start designing your own website there are a few things that
                         you need to understand in order to do this efficiently. Words such as
                        “margin”, “padding” and “border” are things you will most likely 
                         through your designing process. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                        When you think about these things, without involving it with a website you
                         automatically think it’ll have something to do with the white space right?
                          If no then I’m sorry. But hopefully by the end of this blog, you’ll have
                        a clearer idea and the knowledge on how to apply these principles and make
                         better design decisions.
