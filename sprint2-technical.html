                        When you start designing your own website there are a few things that
                         you need to understand in order to do this efficiently. Words such as
                        “margin”, “padding” and “border” are things you will most likely 
                         through your designing process. 
                </p>
                <p>
                        When you think about these things, without involving it with a website you
                         automatically think it’ll have something to do with the white space right?
                          If no then I’m sorry. But hopefully by the end of this blog, you’ll have
                        a clearer idea and the knowledge on how to apply these principles and make
                         better design decisions.

                        Padding and Margin are typically the most common properties in css when spacing your
                         elements. Here is an image below that demonstrates what each part looks like:
                        <br>
                        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/viking_education/web_development/web_app_eng/css_box_model_chrome.png" alt="Margin, border, and padding"
                                class="margin-img">
                        <br>
                        <em>This is when you’ll hear about the CSS term “box model”. Which is basically when
                         talking about design and layout.</em> 
                        <br>
                        <h4>Padding</h4>
                        Is the space between an element content and its border (if it has a border).
                        If an element has a border around it, padding will give space from that border
                        to the element content which appears in that border. If an element does not
                        have a border around it, then adding padding has no effect at all on that
                        element, because there is no border to give space from.
                        <br>
                        <h4>Margin</h4>
                        Is the space of outside of an element to its next outside element. Margin affects
                        elements that both have or do not have borders. If an element has a border, margin
                        defines the space from this border to the next outer element. If an element does
                        not have a border, then margin defines the space from the element content to the
                        next outer element.
                        <br>
                        <h4>Border</h4>
                        The border is the simplest to understand. Just like how you would normally say what
                         a border is, in html it goes around that padding and content. Then outside the border
                          would be the margin, as shown in the image above.
                        <br>
                        <em>So what is the difference between them?</em>To paraphrase everything I've explained so far,
                        while padding deals with the inner space, margin deals with the outer space to the next outer element and
                        border is just a property that outlines the padding and content.
