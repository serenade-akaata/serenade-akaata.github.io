                        When you start designing your own website there are a few things that
                         you need to understand in order to do this efficiently. Words such as
                        “margin”, “padding” and “border” are things you will most likely 
                         through your designing process. 
                </p>
                <p>
                        When you think about these things, without involving it with a website you
                         automatically think it’ll have something to do with the white space right?
                          If no then I’m sorry. But hopefully by the end of this blog, you’ll have
                        a clearer idea and the knowledge on how to apply these principles and make
                         better design decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Padding and Margin are typically the most common properties in css when spacing your
                         elements. Here is an image below that demonstrates what each part looks like:
                        <br>
                        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/viking_education/web_development/web_app_eng/css_box_model_chrome.png" alt="Margin, border, and padding"
                                class="margin-img">
                        <br>
                        This is when you’ll hear about the CSS term “box model”. Which is basically when
                         talking about design and layout. 
                        <br>
                        <h4>Padding</h4>
                        Is the space between an element content and its border (if it has a border).
                         If an element has a border around it, padding will give space from that border
                        to the element content which appears in that border. If an element does not
                        have a border around it, then adding padding has no effect at all on that
                        element, because there is no border to give space from.
                        
                
                
                        </p>
