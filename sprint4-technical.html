                <hr>
                <p>
                    During the FizzBuzz kata, I found myself not being able to reutn a value. I think I
                    spent around 2-3 hours trying to debug the whole code and finding what the error was.
                    Later I decided to ask a friend of mine who already started at Dev to look at my code 
                    and help me. Immediately she found that I had MISSPELT "return". The whole time I was
                    stressing over my code when it was a simple problem. It was times like this I really
                    had to take a break before I exploded.
                    <br>
                    Although from this problem I learnt that I should always check my code more thoroughly,
                    even if it is a simple word, simple words can sometimes be the problem.
                </p>
                <h2 class="top">Did I solve a problem in an elegant way?</h2>
                <p>
                    I dont think I've managed to solve a problem in a elegant way yet. Hopefully throughout 
                    Dev I'll be more confident in doing this. For now I'll just try my best in making sure my
                    code is readiable and makes sense.
                </p>
                <h2 class="top">Using Different Problem Solvng Techniques:</h2>
                <h2 class="top">Pseudocode</h2>
                <p>
                    I found that this techniques was very useful in some cases like the fizzbuzz challenge.
                    Even though I do feel quite confident in using Pseudocode, It did take some practice and Getting
                    use too, before I could use this properly.
                </p>
                <h2 class="top">Trying something</h2>
                <p>
                    Trying something I found to not be very useful, just because half of the time I didn't 
                    understand what it was I was trying to do. So writing in code that I didn't feel confident
                    in writing was sort of pointless.
                </p>
                <h2 class="top">Rubber ducky method</h2>
                <p>
                    I think this method would have to be my favourite method out of the bunch. I found that
                    talking out a problem I was faced with, with an animated object, helped me think About
                    where I went wrong. Most of the times the questions I was asking held the answers in the question.
                </p>
                <h2 class="top">Reading error messages</h2>
                <p>
                    Reading error messages is something im still working on at the moment. Either because sometimes
                    I can find the mistake easy or I dont understand it at all.
                </p>
                <h2 class="top">Console.logging</h2>
                <p>
                    console logging is a pretty good technique when it comes to needing more information that arent
                    being provided already.
                </p>
                <h2 class="top">Googling</h2>
                <p>
                    Google and stack overflow are where I find most of my solutions when I get stuck. But google
                    is probably the easiest for me to understand aslong as Im composing the question Im asking
                    correctly. I found that googling techniques is also a way of improving my problem solving skills
                    because you have to take the example of the techniue given on google and alter it, so it can be appied
                    to your problem.
                </p>
                <h2 class="top">Asking your peers for help</h2>
                <p>
                    I found that asking peers for help is very difficult for me to do. Coming from someone who is Alot 
                    younger and not as experienced as some people, I always have a fear of looking stupid and being judged
                    even though I know not everyone is like this. I think I need to learn how to be okay with asking for help
                    and that asking will lift weights off your shoulders. 
                </p>
                <h2 class="top">Asking coaches for help</h2>
                <p>
                    Asking my facilitators for help is also another thing I struggle in. For some reason I have a fixed 
                    mindset of "having to do things myself", so when it comes to asking people for help I will try to avoid
                    it as much as I can. I noticed that this is something I even do with how I feel. I tend to bottle up my problems
                    without facing them head on. So again I think learning how to be ok with asking for help, and learning to 
                    have a mindset of "asking for help doesnt make you any less stupid" will help the future me.
                </p>
                <h2 class="top">Improving your process with reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    I think Im doing quite well with my reflections. I tend to go into depth most of the times, even when 
                    Im not asked too, simply because it helps me as a person to know what Im doing good in and what I need 
                    to improve. Being able to reflect of task, just shows me how im doing with all of this new information.
