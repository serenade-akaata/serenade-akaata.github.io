                    <hr>
                    <p>
                    Prior to really going deep and thinking about what Identity, values and
                     strengths meant to me, I decided to take the Myers Briggs test. Although
                      the results were not surprising at all, I ended up doing more research
                       on what each attribute meant and found out I’m a perfectionist (which
                        can be a good and bad personality trait to have).  My personality type
                         is Mediator INFP – T. In other words I scored high in being an
                          Introvert, being Intuitive, following my feelings when making
                           decisions and emotions, being prospecting when approaching work,
                            planning and decision-making, and lastly having a turbulent
                             personality.
                     </p>
                     <h2 class="top">Values</h2>
                     <p>
                            After pondering on situations where I’ve had to make an ethical
                            decision, my mind went completely blank. Although one example
                             of an ethical decision I had to make was when I was a lot younger
                            than I am now. I grew up in a large family, me being the youngest
                             and only girl with five brothers, my parents were always strict
                             on me doing chores and my brothers always bossed me around.
                             Fast forward a couple of years and I got abit slack on doing
                             things, I’d leave it to the next day to do or I just wouldn’t
                            do it at all. (I know lol) Anyways my dad thought it was a
                            good idea to start paying us, thinking it would encourage
                            us to do more things. It wasn’t until then that I really
                           realised how important it was to them. Obviously I didn’t
                            take the money. Reasons because 1, their family, which
                              is one of my major personal values and 2, it just wasn’t
                             right.    
                     </p>
                     <p>
                            I grew up in a catholic church and my beliefs since I was little
                             were and are always going to be the same. Culture is also a huge
                              influence in the reasons why I do things. Being a pacific islander,
                               there are always assumptions of how we are portrayed. The way I see
                                things is, if I were to take that money from my parents I would be
                                 taking from myself and knowing how hard it was for my parents to
                                  come to a completely new country and earning that money to raise
                                   a family is what influences me in my everyday decisions.

                            In terms of my personal values some major ones in my life would be honesty, 
                            family and determination, and that’s just a few. Honesty is so big to me. Bottom
                             line is I hate people who lie. Always have and always will, no matter the
                              circumstances. I think honesty to me means that someone is willing to trust
                               you with something whether it be personal or hard to explain and know that
                                you will try to understand them. Family is an easy one for me. Family is
                                 family (whether your blood or not) you can always rely on each other and
                                  know you can count on them to have your back.

                     <p>
                            In terms of strengths I think I can list the ones I think I have, that are already
                             self-explanatory, and that way I won’t need to go to deep in explanation.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Honest</li>
                                    <li>Determined</li>
                                    <li>Reliable</li>
                                    <li>Loyal</li>
                                </ul>
                     </p>
                     <h2 class="top">Weaknesses</h2>
                     <p>
                            With strengths there comes weaknesses and there are always limitations when it
                            comes to my time management. I’m normally good with getting things done on time,
                            but there are the occasional times where I will get distracted. Of course there
                            are times where I actually do have a good reason for not doing something just
                            like now (Getting an extension because the flu in my house is like a spreading virus).
                            But I acknowledge that my time management hasn’t always been good and im working on that.
                     </p>
                     <h2 class="top">Working experience with others</h2>
                     <p>
                    I’m a former University student and I learnt that, there’s nothing wrong with that.
                     I left because I felt that what I was studying wasn’t where I was using my knowledge
                    at its full potential. In my last year attending, I joined a cultural group and was
                    elected as treasurer. For those who may not know what that is, I handled the money
                    and the accounts associated with that association. So I was always making
                    statements and chasing people up on things. Along with a treasurer, there were
                    many other roles filled by other uni students and of course there was bound to
                    be some conflict. There were always problems with people missing meetings,
                     not paying fees and just not showing up. We discussed what the problems were
                    and eventually came to the solution of communication. Communication is vital
                    when working with others and that’s something I can take away from this
                     experience and put it towards future situations.
