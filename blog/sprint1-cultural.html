                    <h2>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h2>
                    <hr>
                    Prior to really going deep and thinking about what Identity, values and
                     strengths meant to me, I decided to take the Myers Briggs test. Although
                      the results were not surprising at all, I ended up doing more research
                       on what each attribute meant and found out I’m a perfectionist (which
                        can be a good and bad personality trait to have).  My personality type
                         is Mediator INFP – T. In other words I scored high in being an
                          Introvert, being Intuitive, following my feelings when making
                           decisions and emotions, being prospecting when approaching work,
                            planning and decision-making, and lastly having a turbulent
                             personality.
