                    <h2>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                    Prior to really going deep and thinking about what Identity, values and
                     strengths meant to me, I decided to take the Myers Briggs test. Although
                      the results were not surprising at all, I ended up doing more research
                       on what each attribute meant and found out I’m a perfectionist (which
                        can be a good and bad personality trait to have).  My personality type
                         is Mediator INFP – T. In other words I scored high in being an
                          Introvert, being Intuitive, following my feelings when making
                           decisions and emotions, being prospecting when approaching work,
                            planning and decision-making, and lastly having a turbulent
                             personality.
                     </p>
                     <h2>Identity</h2>
                     <p>
                            After pondering on situations where I’ve had to make an ethical
                            decision, my mind went completely blank. Although one example
                             of an ethical decision I had to make was when I was a lot younger
                            than I am now. I grew up in a large family, me being the youngest
                             and only girl with five brothers, my parents were always strict
                             on me doing chores and my brothers always bossed me around.
                             Fast forward a couple of years and I got abit slack on doing
                             things, I’d leave it to the next day to do or I just wouldn’t
                            do it at all. (I know lol) Anyways my dad thought it was a
                            good idea to start paying us, thinking it would encourage
                            us to do more things. It wasn’t until then that I really
                           realised how important it was to them. Obviously I didn’t
                            take the money. Reasons because 1, their family, which
                              is one of my major personal values and 2, it just wasn’t
                             right.    
                     </p>

                            I grew up in a catholic church and my beliefs since I was little
                             were and are always going to be the same. Culture is also a huge
                              influence in the reasons why I do things. Being a pacific islander,
                               there are always assumptions of how we are portrayed. The way I see
                                things is, if I were to take that money from my parents I would be
                                 taking from myself and knowing how hard it was for my parents to
                                  come to a completely new country and earning that money to raise
                                   a family is what influences me in my everyday decisions.
