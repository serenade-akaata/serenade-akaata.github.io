                <p>
                        My long term goal has always been to pursue a career in web developing,
                         where I would build websites, create apps and along the way learn a
                          thing or two about game developing. Although I’m quite open to the
                           large range of roles in the tech industry, I’ve always wanted to
                            work for a big company, whether it be in web development or gaming.
                             Coding is a passion for me and I guess I’ve always wanted to make
                              my parents proud. (yes I’m still about that mind-set and love it).
                </p>
                <h2 class="top">Skills</h2>
                <p>
                        While at EDA, I want to be comfortable in working in a close environment
                         and to be able to speak my mind (at appropriate times of course) to
                          ensure my learning. In related to my personality test I took, I’m
                           a very introvert person (95%) to be exact, so being in a space
                            which encourages teamwork, will definitely help me gain the skills
                             needed to take to a future job in tech hopefully.
