                <h2 class="top">Long Term Goals</h2>
                <p>
                        My long term goal has always been to pursue a career in web developing,
                         where I would build websites, create apps and along the way learn a
                          thing or two about game developing. Although I’m quite open to the
                           large range of roles in the tech industry, I’ve always wanted to
                            work for a big company, whether it be in web development or gaming.
                             Coding is a passion for me and I guess I’ve always wanted to make
                              my parents proud. (yes I’m still about that mind-set and love it).
                </p>
                <h2 class="top">Skills</h2>
                <p>
                        While at EDA, I want to be comfortable in working in a close environment
                         and to be able to speak my mind (at appropriate times of course) to
                          ensure my learning. In related to my personality test I took, I’m
                           a very introvert person (95%) to be exact, so being in a space
                            which encourages teamwork, will definitely help me gain the skills
                             needed to take to a future job in tech hopefully. 
                </p>
                <h2 class="top">Strengths and weaknesses</h2>
                <p>
                        Family and friends tend to identify me as Honest and determined. When
                         I put my mind to something I know is worth my time I will do everything
                          in my power to make sure I’m successful in whatever the task or activity
                           is. When it comes to Honesty, people tend to either take it the wrong
                            way or misunderstand what I’m saying. I truly do suck at explaining
                             what is in my mind but I will never lie to someone and if there’s
                              something I truly believe in, I will let my opinions be heard.
                </p>
                <p>
                        As for weaknesses I tend to keep to myself a lot. But then again who’s
                         to say that’s a bad thing.  I’m an introvert what can I say? I will
                          literally remove myself from equations if it involves any type of
                           interaction with people I don’t really know and in this industry
                            that’s not a weakness I should have. So I’m still working towards this.
