                        <p>Through research about what EQ is and how it’s different to IQ,
                             I learnt some key points that are worthy to acknowledge. But first
                             let me explain how I interpreted the differences between the two.</p>
                        <h2 class="top">What are some key differences between EQ and IQ?</h2>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>An individual’s level of emotional intelligence, is
                                    represented by scores gathered in a standardized test,
                                    called Emotional Quotient or EQ for short. Whereas Intelligence Quotient
                                    or IQ is a number obtained from standardised intelligence
                                    test, which represents an individual’s ability of logical
                                    reasoning.</li>
                                <li>
                                    EQ measures an individual’s social and emotional competencies or one’s
                                    ability to recognise one’s own and other person’s emotional expression.
                                    Conversely, IQ measures a person’s academic competency and reasoning ability.</li>

                                <li>An individuals success in school all depends on his IQ level, whereas a person’s EQ level
                                    reflects his success in real life.</li>
                            </ul>
                        And theres are just a few out of many differences between the two.
