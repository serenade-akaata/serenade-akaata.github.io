                        <p>Through research about what EQ is and how it’s different to IQ,
                             I learnt some key points that are worthy to acknowledge. But first
                             let me explain how I interpreted the differences between the two.</p>
                        <h2 class="top">What are some key differences between EQ and IQ?</h2>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>An individual’s level of emotional intelligence, is
                                    represented by scores gathered in a standardized test,
                                    called Emotional Quotient or EQ for short. Whereas Intelligence Quotient
                                    or IQ is a number obtained from standardised intelligence
                                    test, which represents an individual’s ability of logical
                                    reasoning.</li>
                                <li>
                                    EQ measures an individual’s social and emotional competencies or one’s
                                    ability to recognise one’s own and other person’s emotional expression.
                                    Conversely, IQ measures a person’s academic competency and reasoning ability.</li>

                                <li>An individuals success in school all depends on his IQ level, whereas a person’s EQ level
                                    reflects his success in real life.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                And these are just a few out of many differences between the two.
                        </p>
                        <P>
                            I found that through learning what the differences between EQ and IQ are, made me realise
                            why its so important to have EQ and why it works. Here are some reasons why:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Self awareness - Understanding the type of impact you have on the people aroud
                                        you if very important and can help you in the long run.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Having a great workplace culture - Emotions can be contagious, so improving relationship
                                        quality with your peers will help immensely.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Unleash the best version of you - Overall learning how to control your emotions will
                                        help you be a better you.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                        </P>
                        <p>
                            To conclude having an insight on what EQ and IQ is, helped me understand just how relevant
                            it will be for me in the future. I think being able to acknowledge this already is just the start 
                            to a never ending learning experience.
