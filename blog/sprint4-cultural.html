                    and my own learning.
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Understanding that neuroplasticity allows connections between neurons in our brain,
                    benefit people in ways that if we were to repeatedly practice an activity or access
                    a memory, the neurons would group and fire together, creating electrochemical
                    pathways that shape themselves according to that activity or memory. 
                    <br>
                    Ways to use the principles of neuroplasticity for my own learning experience is to
                    practice and go over tasks as said above. This will help build and strengthen the
                    connections between the neurons in my brain. Actively recalling the memory of
                    something will make it easier to recall the memory each time when thought of. 
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some ways to increase ones Neuroplasticity:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Getting enough sleep. Your brain need sleep in order to reset connections that
                             are important for memory and learning.</li>
                        <li>Continuing learning and keep moving </li>
                        <li>Reducing stress in your life</li>
                        <li>Finding a strong purpose for what you’re planning to learn </li>
                        <li>Taking time to read a novel or book </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h2 class="top">What and why is Growth mindset relevant</h2>
                <p>
                    Growth mind-set is recognising your abilities can be developed and engaging them deeply.
                    These students process the error, learn from it and correct it. Without a growth mind-set
                    students have a fixed mind-set, which means they run from their errors instead of
                    embracing an engaging with them. They will take other paths like cheating or finding
                    someone with a lower ability than you and compare themselves to make themselves
                    feel better. This is relevant because if you are wanting to develop growth, you
                    need to have a growth mind-set, so instead of praising intelligence or talent
                    , we should praise the process that people engage in. 
                </p>
                <h2 class="top">Did anything surprise me?</h2>
                <P>
                    Through this exploration I think having Carol Dweck explain that praising one’s intelligence
                    and talent can make you fail in the long run really didn’t surprise me. I think personally
                    praising ones intelligence can deteriorate another’s confidence and cause them to find
                    other solutions as said above. 
                </P>
                <h2 class="top">How will I integrate growth mindset into my learning journey?</h2>
                <p>
                    I think having a positive mind-set and being able to identify your mistakes will
                    help you learn from them and adapt. Learning from experience is the best way to
                    start growth mind-set, because without understanding where your errors are you
                    cannot grow. 
                </p>
                <h2 class="top">Reflecting</h2>
                <P>
                    Learning and understanding these principles will play a major part in shaping my 
                    learning plan. I think these concepts will help influence my handling of my work
                    load, more specifically me getting trapped in rabit holes. I think knonwing
                    that I tend to get stuck in rabit holes, will help me learn from past mistakes
                    and move on.
