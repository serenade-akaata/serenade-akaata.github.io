                    and my own learning.

                <p>
                    Understanding that neuroplasticity allows connections between neurons in our brain,
                    benefit people in ways that if we were to repeatedly practice an activity or access
                    a memory, the neurons would group and fire together, creating electrochemical
                    pathways that shape themselves according to that activity or memory. 
                    <br>
                    Ways to use the principles of neuroplasticity for my own learning experience is to
                    practice and go over tasks as said above. This will help build and strengthen the
                    connections between the neurons in my brain. Actively recalling the memory of
                    something will make it easier to recall the memory each time when thought of.

                <p>
                    Here are some ways to increase ones Neuroplasticity:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Getting enough sleep. Your brain need sleep in order to reset connections that
                             are important for memory and learning.</li>
                        <li>Continuing learning and keep moving </li>
                        <li>Reducing stress in your life</li>
                        <li>Finding a strong purpose for what youâ€™re planning to learn </li>
                        <li>Taking time to read a novel or book </li>
                    </ul>
